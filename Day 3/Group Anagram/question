Given an array of words, print the count of all anagrams together in sorted order (increasing order of counts).
For example, if the given array is {“cat”, “dog”, “tac”, “god”, “act”}, then grouped anagrams are “(dog, god) (cat, tac, act)”. So the output will be 2 3.

Input:
First line consists of T test case. First line of every test case consists of N, denoting the number of words in array. Second line of every test case consists of words of array.

Output:
Single line output, print the counts of anagrams in increasing order.
