Given an array, containing only 0 and 1 as its elements. The elements are kept in random order. You have to sort the array. The constraints are:
1. You cannot count or add the elements of arrays.
2. You cannot use extra array. 
For example, if the input array is: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], then the output array must be: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Expected Complexity: Try doing it in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity. Here, n is the size of array.
